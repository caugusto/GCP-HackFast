## Introduction

Throughout this game, you will be using a number of different tools and products within Google Cloud. Our focus in this first challenge will be installing the necessary technologies in your Google Cloud environment to ensure your success throughout the hack.


## Steps 



1. Select or create a Google Cloud project.
    1. Make sure all team members have access to the project 
2. Enable billing for your project.
3. Enable the Compute Engine, Datastream, Dataflow and Pub/Sub APIs.
4. To set up your own Looker model and dashboards, you must have developer access on a Looker instance. To request a trial, see the [Looker free trial demo](https://looker.com/demo/free-trial).
5. For the purposes of this tutorial, you may elect to deploy an Oracle Database XE instance on Docker/Google Cloud Compute Engine. For more information regarding Oracle Database XE licensing, please check  https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/xe.html

When you finish this tutorial, you can avoid continued billing by deleting the resources you created. See [Cleaning up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xxb7B7nZ7fQaHo8TdPDsxurZ7u1-wzAfgWwXQyt-r4k/edit#heading=h.mlrdlgcohh7k) for more detail.


## You can move on if: 



1. You have a Google Cloud Project that all team members have access to, has billing enabled, and the Compute Engine, Datastream, Dataflow and Pub/Sub APIs enabled
2. You have developer access on a Looker instance
3. You have deployed an Oracle Database
