<b>Building and visualizing demand forecast predictions using Datastream, BigQuery ML and Looker</b>

This document shows you how to  replicate and process operational data from an Oracle database into Google Cloud in real time. The tutorial also demonstrates how to forecast future demand, and how to visualize this data as it arrives. 
This tutorial is intended for data engineers and analysts who want to utilize their operational data. It assumes that youâ€™re familiar with writing SQL queries and UDF functions.

The tutorial uses a fictitious retail store, FastFresh, to help demonstrate the concepts it describes. This store specializes in selling fresh produce, and wants to minimize food waste and optimize their stock levels across all stores.  You use fictitious sales transactions from FastFresh as the operational data in the tutorial..



The preceding diagram showcases the flow of operational data through Google Cloud:
- Incoming data from an Oracle source is captured and replicated into Cloud Storage via Datastream. 
- This data is processed and enriched by Dataflow templates, and is then sent to BigQuery.
- BigQuery ML is used to forecast demand for your data, which is then visualized in Looker.
